        <h1>Historical significance</h1>
        <p>Tea was first introduced to Britain in the 17th century and quickly became a popular beverage. It was heavily
            promoted by the East India Company, which had a monopoly on the tea trade. The popularity of tea in Britain
            grew throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, and it became a symbol of British culture and identity.
